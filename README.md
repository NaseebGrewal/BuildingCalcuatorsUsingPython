# Building Calculators Using Python

This repository contains Python solutions to various calculator projects, including **Arithmetic Formatter** and **Time Calculator**. These projects were completed as part of the **FreeCodeCamp** challenges on **January 24, 2023**.

## Projects

### 1. Arithmetic Formatter

This project solves the **Arithmetic Formatter** challenge from FreeCodeCamp. The goal is to format simple arithmetic expressions (addition and subtraction) in a specific visual format.

### 2. Time Calculator

This project solves the **Time Calculator** challenge from FreeCodeCamp. The purpose is to add a specified number of hours and minutes to a given starting time and return the result in a readable format.

## Files in this Repository

- **`.gitignore`**: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git (e.g., `.pyc` files).
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **`arithmetic_arranger.py`**: The Python script for the Arithmetic Formatter project.
- **`main.py`**: The main script that connects and runs both projects.
- **`shape_calculator.py`**: This file contains code for a shape-related calculator, which was intended for future expansion.
- **`time_calculator.py`**: The Python script for the Time Calculator project.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BuildingCalculatorsUsingPython.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd BuildingCalculatorsUsingPython
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (if any). You can skip this step if there are no external dependencies.

## How to Use

1. **Arithmetic Formatter**:
   To use the arithmetic formatter, run the following:
   ```bash
   python arithmetic_arranger.py
   ```

2. **Time Calculator**:
   To use the time calculator, run the following:
   ```bash
   python time_calculator.py
   ```

3. **Main Program**:
   To run both projects together, use:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Features

- **Arithmetic Formatter**: Takes a list of arithmetic expressions and returns them in a formatted visual representation.
- **Time Calculator**: Adds a specified time interval to a starting time and handles edge cases (e.g., midnight rollovers, day counting).
